This document defines the near term vision and strategy for the Atos Cloud.

The Atos Cloud is not one single thing; it is an amalgamation of many cloud elements. Brought together to support the wider Atos digital transformation story.
No single entity within Atos has the sole accountability for building all these elements. They are each built by the team best suited to the individual task. Furthermore, some cloud elements are beyond the scope of interest from a build perspective, here we will leverage our partnerships.
Given this decentralised model it is essential that we define an overarching vision and strategy for cloud. That not only links all of these cloud elements and bridges them in to the digital story but also influences the onward evolution of them and the creation of new ones.
